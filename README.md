## Machine Learning Project: Used Car Price Prediction using _Random Forest Algorithm_ and _Web Deployment_
### Live App : [See Here](https://vivekraina7-cars24-price-prediction-prediction-model-7juh3n.streamlit.app/)

1. Developed a machine learning project to predict the price of used cars using the Random Forest algorithm.
2. Used Python programming language and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit to build the project.
3. Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applied feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for model training.
4. Trained a Random Forest model on the prepared data and achieved a high accuracy score.
5. Built a web app using Streamlit to deploy the model and enable users to input the car details to get an estimated price prediction.
6. Tested the model and web app thoroughly to ensure accuracy and functionality.
7. Demonstrated strong skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and web app deployment.
8. This project can be used as a practical example of how machine learning algorithms can be used to solve real-world problems and deployed as web applications.
